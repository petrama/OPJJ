# In each line, everything after the sign '#' should be treated as a comment.

# Check that filename is correct; please observe that in strings a variable replacement
# must be supported, so if the content of the variable "jmbag" is "0012345678", the
# string shown below will be resolved as: "0012345678-dz1.zip". Letter "i" in front of
# the string indicates that the string should be treated as case-insensitive; without
# this, string should be treated as case-sensitive.
